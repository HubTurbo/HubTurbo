# Working with Boards and Panels

An overview of Panels was provided in the [UI Basics](UI-Basics.md).

### Adding a New Panel <a name="add"></a>

Panels can be added using the menu or keyboard shortcuts. 

- `Panels > Create Panel` to add a panel on the right of the currently selected panel.
    - <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> will do the same.

- `Panels > Create Panel (Left)` to add a panel on the left.
    - <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> will do the same.

### Closing a Panel <a name="close"></a>

- Click on the `x` button at the top of the panel.

- `Panels > Close Panel`
    - <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>W</kbd> will do the same.

### Reordering Panels <a name="reorder"></a>

Panels can be reordered simply by dragging them into the desired position.

- Click on the space next to the `x` button and move the panel to the left or right.

## Boards

A collection of panels is called a board. HubTurbo has ways to manage them as well.

### Saving a Board

- The current board will be saved when you quit the application. The same borad will be loaded next time you run HubTurbo.

- You may also save a board under a name via `Boards > Save`.

### Opening a Board

- Select the board you want to open under `Boards > Open`. It will clear the current board and open the requested one.

### Deleting a Board

- Select the board you want to remove under `Boards > Delete`.
